# D&D-Max-Hit-Points-Calculator

To run the standalone calculator: Simply download the .exe application file in bin/Release and run.

Using the calculator:
1. Enter your character's current Max HP (or enter 0 if you're creating a new level 1 character)
2. Enter your character's Constitution modifier
3. Select the correct hit die for your character's class (this can be found in the rules/description for your class) from the dropdown and click "Roll" - the roll will be displayed in the text box and the value will be filled into "Hit Die Roll"
4. Click "Calculate Max Hit Points" to perform the calculation for your character's new Max HP! The calculation will be written out to the text box so you (or your DM) can check your work, and the new HP will be updated into "Current Max HP" to make rolling multiple levels at one time a snap.
